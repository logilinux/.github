# LogiLinux - Linux drivers for Logitech devices

> currently supporting the MX Creative Console


## About

At Lauzhack's Logitech challenge, we found that the entire Logitech plugin ecosystem was unavailable on linux. We found this counterintuitive - with the linux community being the biggest proponents of open source extensibility to any tech ecosystem in the world. 

We wanted to build something impactful and novel. A ground-up C++ driver library/ecosystem for logitech devices on Linux felt like the best approach. With supported Python SDKs, and a provided action-mapping GUI as close to Logi Options Plus, we have tried making the process as seamless as possible. 

Currently the system works solely for the MX Creative Console, being one of the newer and more obscure pieces of Logitech hardware as a strong foundation that covers any worst-case functionality that we would need to implement. This org contains the `logilinux-drivers`, the `logilinux-gui` and a `logilinux-sdk`.
